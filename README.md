# Cloud App Labs at OpenStack Summit Barcelona 2016

![openstack summit barcelona](/Cloud App Labs Barcelona.png)

Welcome to the OpenStack Summit.  The following 'Cloud App Labs' are part of the growing 'OpenStack Application Academy' and will be located in the Summit Marketplace aka Expo Hall. This repository contains a series of 'cloud app labs' to help you get self-started with becoming a cloud application engineer - the future of app development.

TL;DR = Learn the skills to become a 'Cloud Application Engineer' - ask Q's anytime by sending a tweet which includes [#CloudApps](https://twitter.com/hashtag/cloudapps) + your question.

Overall Learning Objectives (by completing these labs you will know how to...)
 - [x] work as part of a cloud app team, whose collaboration with one another is paramount for success.
 - [x] be inpsired to build cloud apps which are cross-cloud (not locked into cloud operating systems).
 - [x] understand how to recover from failure by engaging the wider OpenStack developer community.
 - [x] make cloud apps which are simple (constrained at the start so they can be further configured as they evolve).
 - [x] know where to go to for further help and ideas for building the cloud app of the future.

Depending on your skill level, each lab will take anywhere from five to forty-five minutes.
Labs are designed to start easy and get more difficult, so as to keep you playfully challenged.
You can get help on each lab by simply hanging out in the "App Engineering Lounge" and asking for help at the info-desk; or you can ask for someone to come and find you via [#cloudapps](https://twitter.com/hashtag/cloudapps) hashtag on twitter (we'll be monitorring [#OpenStack](https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpenStack) #CloudApp Q's throughout).

The process for completing labs and earining points is simple:
 1. select a lab (below) to complete;
 2. get help to complete the lab;
 3. show your lab result to the community to get points;
 4. use your points to claim Stacker swag at the 'App Labs' lounge.
 5. Repeat, goto --> 1

To get you started you'll need to have the following pre-requisites:
 * a laptop with wifi access and SSH ports open.
 * basic Python scripting skills
 * an account on one of the many OpenStack public clouds: if you don't have one, we have one for you.
 * an SSH key and basic understanding for how to apt-get install applications on the cloud (only very basic).

--> [Setup your laptop to work with an OpenStack powered datacenter to do a cloud app lab.](/prereq)

To get started select a lab below, when you need some help come swing by the 'Cloud App Lab' lounge in the Marketplace (expo hall).  Alternativley ask one of our friendly community folks to come and meet up with you via twitter, just send a tweet "I can haz help? Meet me in the #CloudApps lab lounge? #OpenStack" <-- just remember to use the [#CloudApps](https://twitter.com/hashtag/cloudapps) hashtag.

## Contribute your own app lab!

If you have an idea for a fun app lab which we can add to this repository, please don't hesitate to branch/pull.

... let's get started!

# Cloud App Lab no.1 - [StackTour: an overview of OpenStack projects as per the buttons they relate to on the Web dashboard.](/StackTour.md)

 - What you'll learn in this lab: which buttons on the OpenStack dashboard (Horizon) align with which OpenStack project (Nova, Neutron, Cinder, Swift, Glance, etc).
 - Skill level = n00b (easy), understand SSH keys and basics of launching VMs using the dashboard GUI.
 - Stacker can score = +1 point for completing this lab.

# Cloud App Lab no.2 - [StackEntrance: having an entrace to all OpenStack public clouds worldwide](/StackerEntrance.md)
About this lab:
 - What you'll learn in this lab: how to configure your code so that you don't have to use the dashboard, but can instead use simple python scripts to get access to Datacenters powered by OpenStack worldwide (os-cloud-config.py)  Yes that's right one simple file is all you need to access hundreds of clouds (clouds.yaml)
 - Lab level: intermediate, need to understand basic authentication via command line, use of yaml as a simple structured document for storring login details.
 - Stacker can score: +3 points for completing this lab.

# Cloud App Lab no.???

Do you have an idea for a lab?  
Please do suggest!  Or just 'fork' and 'pull' now :)

# Cloud App Lab no.NN - StackContainers: start splitting out the state of your app workers to be more agile (self healing) as containers which can dynamically shift accross datacentres worldwide.

Coming soon.
