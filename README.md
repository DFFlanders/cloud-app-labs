# Cloud App Labs at OpenStack Summit Barcelona 2016

![openstack summit barcelona](https://www.sebastien-han.fr/blog/images/openstack-summit-2016-barcelona.jpg)

Welcome to the OpenStack Summit.  The following 'cloud app labs' are part of the growing 'OpenStack Applicaiton Academy' and will be located in the Summit Marketplace aka Expo Hall. This repository contains a series of 'cloud app labs' to help you get started with becoming a cloud application engineer - the future of app development.

Overall Learning Objectives (by completing these labs you will know how to...)
 - [x] work as part of a cloud app team, whose collaboration with one another is paramount for success.
 - [x] be inpsired to build cloud apps which are cross-cloud (not locked into cloud operating systems).
 - [x] understand how to recover from failure by engaging the wider OpenStack developer community.
 - [x] make cloud apps which are simple (constrained at the start so they can be further configured as they evolve).
 - [x] know where to go to for further help and ideas for building the cloud app of the future.

Depending on your skill level, each lab will take anywhere from five to forty-five minutes.
Labs are designed to start easy and get more difficult, so as to keep you playfully challenged.
You can get help on each lab by simply hanging out in the "App Engineering Lounge" and raising your hand; or you can ask questions via our slack channel.

The process for completing labs and earining points is simple:
 1. select a lab (below) to complete
 2. get help to complete the lab
 3. show your result to the community to get points
 4. use your points to claim Stacker swag at the 'App Labs' lounge.
 5. repeat, goto --> 1

To get started we'll need to have the following pre-requisites:
 * a laptop
 * basic Python scripting skills
 * an account on one of the many OpenStack public clouds: if you don't have one, we have one for you.
 * an SSH key and basic understanding for how to install applications on the cloud (only very basic).

If you would like to get started with the first lab please do, otherwise stop by cloud app lab area to get help.

## Contribute your own app lab!

If you have an idea for a fun app lab which we can add to this repository, please don't hesitate to branch/pull.  Other ideas, have a chat with fellow app-dev via the slack channel.
