# What is a "Cloud Application Engineer" aka "AppEng?

A _Cloud Application Engineer_ is a roll we've started to see emerge in the "cloud sector" (aka "using software which sits in a datacenter vs on your own computer").  An Application Engineer, differs from that of a 'Application Specifically an AppEng specialises in the architectural engineering of applications for use accross multiple open cloud platforms. The raison d'etre of an "AppEng" is to assure that a company producing 'cloud apps' are not locked into any one cloud operating system (cost savings, yo!).  A Cloud Application Engineer will know the architectural cloud application patterns which enable a cloud app to grow its user base as it grows and expands via load, geography, size and shape.  Above all else, they are efficient (and a bit lazy ;)

## An anti-pattern job description:  
I find anti-patterns can be helpful in comparison to other jobs of similar type.  While 'Cloud Application Engineers' will share skills with all of the following "developers" in the stack, they differ via the following key skillsets:
 - How is an AppEng unlike an NetEng ≠ An Enng Eng (while continually conversive with the NetEng for guidance) does not know the details of the network stack (IPV layers), other than in regards to 
 - How is an AppEng unlike a SysAdmin ≠ An AppEng (while understanding the basics of server configuration and performance, and always eager to learn more from an experienced SysAdmin), cannot assure the uptime of servers ("number of nines") nor their lifecycle maitenance and fault tollerant mechanical performance over time.
 - How is an AppEng unlike a DevOpps ≠ AppEng do not care about dozens or hundreds of applications, they care about a few applications (less than 5 cloud apps at any given time).
 - How is an AppEng unlike an AppDev ≠ AppEng do not invent software, they are not involved in the business of "start-ups" where an idea is invented and then brought to life as a product and business.  
 - How is an AppEng unlike a UXer ≠ AppEng do not have the usability testing methods or behaviour unit testing toolboxes which a UXer will employ in their day to day.  
 
Above all, the primary feedback loop which an AppEng achieves is to get the advice of these other experts on their teams.

DISCLAIMER: Please note, the above is not intended to pigeon-hole developers into any single role, rather it is expected that many devleopers will occupy these roles and skillsets at different times in their carreer (it's an AND not an OR).  Some developers might even be a kind of 'unicorn' capable of acting like a 'full stack developer' in several of these skill areas.  Warning: 'unicorn full stack developers' do not usually play nice with teams, and a team is what you need if you want to build a cloud app.

# Job Description: Cloud Application Engineer

Below are some common criteria which companies might use as part of a job application to hire a 'Cloud Application Engineer':

The primary aim of Applicaiton Engineer at our company/institution will be to scale up our most popular applications so that they are more efficient, thereby resulting in greater productivity of our most significant asset: the collective intelligence of the company both humans and machines.  Accordingly, the AppEng will continually have (and further seek out) the following skillsets as part of their job (which is one of continous learning):
 - The 'Usability Expert' (UXer) will regularly provide feedbak on the features 
 - 
 - awareness and emotional intelligence for the range of expert skills available for their use and consultation.
 - leadership 
 - consultative

  ## Job descripotion statements:

 - Our software engineers work with Cloud Service Providers (e.g. search engine, social network and e-commerce providers) to optimize software stacks for our company and its customers. AppEng contribute to the corporate mission by: a.) helping define what the future platform looks like for our staff and customers, b.) assist with competitive platform comparison and characterization to help define our applications efficiencies, c.) regular configure and execute workload performance characterization experiments with a team of developers, including: "Network Engineers, System Adminstrators, Developer Operations, Application Devleopers, Usability Experts, etc., and d.) AppEng will be measured by their ability to define and show engineering efficiencies which will directly benefit the users increased productivity.
 - Responsibility for 'productivity efficiencies' will include: software optimization, power optimization, performance and efficiency analysis, configuration of performance analysis infrastructure, customer-facing collaboration, training and support, usability+behavioural testing efficiencies and the identification of best practices to be used in the creation of collateral and case studies to define efficiency.
 - Other responsibilities include customer and internal communication (written and verbal), and working across multiple organizations to define and enable solutions in both customer and internal environments. Will be a sincere advocate for our technologies with customers; and vice versa, for customers' needs and viewpoints with all other company developers/engineers.
