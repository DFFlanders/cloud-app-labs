# What is a "Cloud Application Engineer" aka "AppEng?

Defining _'Cloud Application Engineering'_ 

First let's define 'cloud apps'. 'Cloud applications' are apps which operate in a datacente; as opposed to, apps on your mobile phone or laptop.  'Cloud apps' are application which a general cosumer would access via 'online applications', i.e. via your browser, through apps on your phone/tablet, via SMS and/or any other 'Internet connected device' which requires access to 'timely data' and/or 'big data'.  Example of well known cloud apps would include: Uber, Pokeman, Twitter/Facebook, CandyCrush... Also worth noting are the portals which host these applications, so called "Cloud Applications Platforms" (AKA PaaS), which are emerging in the form of Google Drive Apps (aka Google Suite), Salesforce Apps, Apple iCloud, Microsoft365, etc.

What then is a 'Cloud Application Engineer'?  Let's begin with their 'high level' obligations (remit) to their employers, which is a simple measurable set of formulas to demonstrate efficiency (_as defined by engineering_).

From Wikipedia: _"efficiency is measured as the ratio of useful output to total input, which can be expressed with the mathematical formula r=P/C, where P is the amount of useful output ("product") produced per the amount C ("cost") of resources consumed._

## What are the aims and objectives which a 'Cloud Application Engineer' should achieve for their employeer?

Aim:  _Demonstrably advance how a company producing 'cloud apps' are optimising their human and machine workers for shared cost effectiveness via the engineering measures of producitvity and efficieny gains_.

Objectives:

 - [x] specialise in the architectural engineering of applications for use accross multiple cloud platforms, for the purpose of cost effective effciency.
 - [x] know the architectural cloud application patterns which enable a 'cloud apps' to grow its 'user base' for the purpose of consumer integration efficiency.
 - [x] enable the..... for the purpose of customer ease, ergo productivty.
 - [x] bla bla...... for.....  networking engineering, 
 - [x] ......grow the producitvity of the 'cloud app' as it expands via load, geography, size and shape.


``Timelyness, An AppEng is brought into the development team, post inception of the customer strategy having been established.
 - Above all else, AppEng are efficient (and a bit lazy ;)

## Job role statements for Application Engineering:

 - The primary aim of Application Engineer at our company/institution will be to scale up our most popular applications so that they are more efficient, thereby resulting in greater productivity of our most significant asset: the collective intelligence of the company both humans and machines.  Accordingly, the AppEng will continually have (and further seek out) the following skillsets as part of their job (which is one of continous learning):...
 - Our software engineers work with Cloud Service Providers (e.g. search engine, social network and e-commerce providers) to optimize software stacks for our company and its customers. AppEng contribute to the corporate mission by: a.) helping define what the future platform looks like for our staff and customers, b.) assist with competitive platform comparison and characterization to help define our applications efficiencies, c.) regular configure and execute workload performance characterization experiments with a team of developers, including: "Network Engineers, System Adminstrators, Developer Operations, Application Devleopers, Usability Experts, etc., and d.) AppEng will be measured by their ability to define and show engineering efficiencies which will directly benefit the users increased productivity.
 - Responsibility for 'productivity efficiencies' will include: software optimization, power optimization, performance and efficiency analysis, configuration of performance analysis infrastructure, customer-facing collaboration, training and support, usability+behavioural testing efficiencies and the identification of best practices to be used in the creation of collateral and case studies to define efficiency.
 - Other responsibilities include customer and internal communication (written and verbal), and working across multiple organizations to define and enable solutions in both customer and internal environments.

# Appendices and Further Notes
Please ignore, notes to self...

Below is a pending draft blog post by Flanders and are his views alone ;-)  Really, these are just a series of 'observances' which I've been tracking to see if there is merrit in this observed pattern? /dff

On a person note: 
  - The primary problem the "cloud sector" is currently facing is that is has no discernable collection of 'cloud applications' to emerge panopticon.  And yes, I'm alluding to something _like_ the 'Android Marketplace' or 'iPhone store' as a kind of 'plug and play' consumer facing repository. Indeed, most of these apps will be for coporate enterprises, however a degree of centralisation and/or interoperability need to emerge before we'll see the customers, employees and end-users of these coporations satisfied with the app toolsets which they can implement to run their projects and teams.  Above all else, it is the enterprise which will be the ones to pay for cost of application development (as the 'app stores' have proven to be little else other than an in-efficient tithe platforms for humble developers).
  - The world will look back on this time in our human/robot era and mock us for the state of technology.  The irony: it is companies who are paying a fortune for technology, and yet the enterprise application on offer are worse than the free tools which we all have in our personal lives.   
  - How is it that the data driven industries in which we all work are allowing the primary resource (our productivity to be continually hindered and angered through the continual impediment which is enterprise applications).  

## An anti-pattern job description:  
I find anti-patterns can be helpful in comparison to other jobs of similar type.  While 'Cloud Application Engineers' will share skills with all of the following "developers" in the stack, they differ via the following key skillsets:
 - How is an AppEng unlike an NetEng ≠ An Enng Eng (while continually conversive with the NetEng for guidance) does not know the details of the network stack (IPV layers), other than in regards to 
 - How is an AppEng unlike a SysAdmin ≠ An AppEng (while understanding the basics of server configuration and performance, and always eager to learn more from an experienced SysAdmin), cannot assure the uptime of servers ("number of nines") nor their lifecycle maitenance and fault tollerant mechanical performance over time.
 - How is an AppEng unlike a DevOpps ≠ AppEng do not care about dozens or hundreds of applications, they care about a few applications (less than 5 cloud apps at any given time).
 - How is an AppEng unlike an AppDev ≠ AppEng do not invent software, they are not involved in the business of "start-ups" where an idea is invented and then brought to life as a product and business.  
 - How is an AppEng unlike a UXer ≠ AppEng do not have the usability testing methods or behaviour unit testing toolboxes which a UXer will employ in their day to day.  
 
Above all, the primary feedback loop which an AppEng achieves is to get the advice of these other experts on their teams.

DISCLAIMER: Please note, the above is not intended to pigeon-hole developers into any single role, rather it is expected that many devleopers will occupy these roles and skillsets at different times in their carreer (it's an AND not an OR).  Some developers might even be a kind of 'unicorn' capable of acting like a 'full stack developer' in several of these skill areas.  Warning: 'unicorn full stack developers' do not usually play nice with teams, and a team is what you need if you want to build a cloud app.

### some assumptions (risks)
  - The industry goal of AI while 
  - Remember that for every  1% decrease in the global human workforce (an N% increase in the robot workforce) there are forty-thousand deaths.  Waxing lyrical on this data, if self-driving cars come into existence and start to replace the transportation industry (taxis, deliveries, shipments, etc) this could potentially have a devastating impact on our industry.
