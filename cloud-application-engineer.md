# What is a "Cloud Application Engineer" aka "AppEng?

A _Cloud Application Engineer_ sits somewhere between an ApDev and DevOpps.  Specifically an AppEng specialises in the architectural engineering of applications for use accross multiple open cloud platforms. The raison d'etre of an "AppEng" is to assure that a company producing 'cloud apps' are not locked into any one cloud operating system (cost savings, yo!).  A Cloud Application Engineer will know the architectural cloud application patterns which enable a cloud app to grow its user base as it grows and expands via load, geography, size and shape.  Above all else, they are efficient (and a bit lazy ;)

## An anti-pattern job description:  
Perhaps the best way to define a new job role is to define its anti-pattern in comparison to other similar job descriptions.  While 'Cloud Application Engineers' will share skills with all of the following engineers in the stack, they differ via the following key skillsets:
 - How is an AppEng unlike an NetEng...
 - How is an AppEng unlike a SysAdmin...
 - How is an AppEng unlike a DevOpps...
 - How is an AppEng unlike an AppDev...
 - How is an AppEng unlike a UXer...

DISCLAIMER: Please note, the above is not intended to pigeon-hole developers into any single role, rather it is expected that many devleopers will occupy these roles and skillsets at different times in their carreer (it's an AND not an OR).  Some developers might even be a kind of 'unicorn' capable of acting like a 'full stack developer' in several of these skill areas.  Warning: 'unicorn full stack developers' do not usually play nice with teams, and a team is what you need if you want to build a cloud app.
