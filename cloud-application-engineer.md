# What is a "Cloud Application Engineer" aka "AppEng?

A Cloud Application Engineer is a specialist 'Application Developer' (or a 'user focused DevOpps') who specialises in the architectural engineering of applications for use accross multiple open cloud platforms. The raison d'etre of an "AppEng" is to assure that a company producing 'cloud apps' are not locked into any one cloud operating system.  A Cloud Application Engineer will know the architectural cloud application patterns which enable a cloud app to grow its user base as it grows and expands via load, geography, size and shape.  

## An anti-pattern job description:  
Perhaps the best way to define a new job role is to define its anti-pattern in comparison to other similar job descriptions.  While 'Cloud Application Engineers' will share skills with all of the following engineers in the stack, they differ via the following key skillsets:
 - Unlike an NetEng...
 - Unlike a SysAdmin...
 - Unlike a DevOpps...
 - Unlike an AppDev...
 - Unlike a UXer...
 

DISCLAIMER: Please note, the above is not intended to pigeon-hole developoers into any single role, rather it is expected that many devleopers will occupy these roles and skillsets at different times in their carreer.  Some developers might even be a kind of 'unicorn' capable of acting like a 'full stack developer'.
