# StackData Application Laboratory

Welcome to the OpenStack Cloud App Lounge!  Below you will find the fifth (5of6) app lab challenges.  Each lab is a playful way to see if you have what it takes to be a ['Cloud Application Engineer'](/cloud-application-engineer.md) - the future of apps. 

Before you being, don't forget to [setup your laptop with the OpenStack powered cloud of your choice](/prereq).

## Learning context for completing the lab
 - Building on the previous CloudAppLab, your customers: the professors are happy with your work!  Congratulations, however with success come more users ergo more work.  
 - The Fractals application which you now have working accross multiple datacentres worldwide is starting to accumlate masses of data!  Millions of fractals worldwide are being generated by researchers who are seeking the perfect prime fractal.
 - The professors want to do analysis of all this data to do further research.  They need this data to be easily and quickly accessible as they conduct their own research on the millions of fractal images which have been generated.  As the professors are not trained software engineers their tools are basic, ranging from spreadsheets to some basic scripting via Matlab, R and some Python.  They need the data accessible to these core tool which they use daily.
 - Accorindly, in this lab you are going to need to collect the data in a single accessible place
