Lab challenge context
Welcome to the OpenStack Cloud App Lounge!  We have several fun lab challenges for you to complete so you can start your training to become a ['cloud application engineer'](/cloud-application-engineer).  

How to win your stacker points, aka 'Stacker Swag'.
--> You'll get Stacker swag point(s) for every picture you tweet showing a button on the OpenStack public cloud of your choice which represents the following [core OpenStack projects](https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator/).  For example, here is a picture of a button which works with the Keystone project:

![Image of OpenStack login screen via default horizon dashboard, which makes calls to the keystone API for authentication of users](/Selection_063.png "Default login screen which makes 'calls to the keystone project API to login users")

You can collect points by sending a tweet with a picture showing buttons which make calls to:
  - [ ] Nova = +1 Stacker points
  - [ ] Neutron = +1 Stacker points
  - [ ] Swift = +1 Stacker points
  - [ ] Cinder = +1 Stacker points
  - [ ] Glance = +1 Stacker points
  
Once you've collected points for each of the core projects above, you can gain additional bonus points by tweeting an image of a button which makes calls to the following other 'big tent' projects:

 - [ ] Magnum = +2 Stacker points
 - [ ] Murano = +2 Stacker points
 - [ ] Zun = = +2 Stacker points
 
 To redeem your points, go to the 'Cloud App Lounge' and show your tweets+picture after they have been "‚ù§'d" by one of our ['cloud app lab pros' via their twitter+irc handles](/cloud-app-lab-pros)
