# StackTour Application Laboratory

Welcome to the OpenStack Cloud App Lounge!  Below you will find the first 'cloud app lab' challenges.  Each lab is a playful way to see if you have what it takes to be a ['Cloud Application Engineer'](/cloud-application-engineer.md) - the future of apps! 

Before you begin, don't forget to [setup your laptop with the OpenStack powered cloud of your choice](/prereq.md).

## Lab challenge context:
  1. _Imagine_ the CTO of your company has just asked you to give the 'board of directors' an overview of which OpenStack projects the company should know about; the board wants to make a decision on where to have their engineers participate.
  2. As fast as you can (your meeting is in fifteen minutes!), you need to learn what each of the major OpenStack projects do and how they relate to the main OpenStack dashboard.  
  3. To best explain OpenStack to your bosses, imagine that each project is a robot and that project-robot goes off and does something for your user *via buttons on the OpenStack dashboard*.  You need to explain what each robot army is capable of doing via the buttons that activate them.  You'll need to describe the following robot armies and what their buttons activate = Nova, Neutron, Swift, Cinder, Glance and Keystone.
  4. If Google isn't fast enough to discover what you need to know about each of the project-robots, [get one of the Cloud App Pros to help (they want to answer your questions!)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RBtAOjxmUh97fXrJlowvqVNmq2-8FxvBIHx2Dts1Jh8/pub?start=true&loop=true&delayms=1000). Go, go, go!
  5. Remember your boses won't understand all the functions of each robot, so you need to have simple (tweetable) explanations of each robot army and what they can do for your orgnisation per button on the dashboard.
  6. Most importantly, don't forget that your boss will ask you for contacts in the OpenStack community so you can start asking questions on how to get involved.  Start building that rolodex of community contacts by asking for help!
  
## Lab learning objectives (by completing this lab you will know how to...)
 - [x] ...identify the core project APIs which make up all OpenStack powered clouds.
 - [x] ...meet key community members who can help you navigate the expanding world of OpenStack.
 - [x] ...understand the diligence of community based code review (as per the OpenStack-way of +1/+2 code review, in this case you'll be getting the community to "❤" your tweets).

## How to complete this lab (to win your Stacker points):
  - Tweet a picture of a button from the OpenStack dashboard which represents a feature for each one of the OpenStack projects (see core robot armies below), and explain what this robot army can do for your organisations users!
  - You'll get Stacker swag point(s) for every picture you tweet showing a button which represents one of the different Core OpenStack projects (see below).
  - Send pictures for the following OpenStack project-robots along with what this army of robots can do!
   - [ ] Tweet a picture of a 'nova button' along with "What the 'Nova robot army' can do for your company?" = +1 StackerPoints
   - [ ] Tweet a picture of a 'neutron button' along with "What the 'Neutron robot army' do for your company?" = +1 StackerPoints
   - [ ] Tweet a picture of a 'swift button' along with "What can the 'Swift robot army' can do for your customers?"= +1 StackerSwag points
   - [ ] Tweet a picture of a 'cinder button' along with "What the 'Cinder robot army' can do for your bosses?" = +1 StackerSwag points
   - [ ] Tweet a picture of a 'glance button' along with "What the 'Glance robot army' can do for your institution?" = +1 StackerSwag points
   
To help get you started, here is a picture of a "keystone button" and what the "keystone robot army' can do your users:

Once you've collected points for each of the core projects (nova, neutron, swift, cinder, glance) above, you can gain additional bonus points by tweeting an image of a button which makes calls to the following other 'big tent' project-robots (you can only collect points for the below after you've collected points from the above):

 - [ ] Magnum = +1 StackerSwag points
 - [ ] Murano = +2 StackerSwag points
 - [ ] Zun = = +2 StackerSwag points
 
## To redeem your points: 
 1. Take a picture of a button which represents each of the OpenStack projects-robots and tweet it with a simple descriptive message via the #CloudApps hashtag (which is being monitorred by the 'cloud app pros'). 
 2. Go to the 'Cloud App Lab' lounge helpdesk in the Marketplace (expo hall) and show your tweets+picture after they have been "❤'d" by one of our ['cloud app lab pros' via their twitter+irc handles](/cloud-app-lab-pros)
 3. Don't forget to get your tweets +1'd with a heart ❤ as the OpenStack community believes in [community driven code review](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/How_To_Contribute)
 4. Once you have [Stacker Points you can redeem them for Stacker swag](https://github.com/DFFlanders/cloud-app-labs/blob/master/StackerPoints.md)!
 5. Redeem your StackerPoint for swag at the 'Cloud App Labs' lounge in the main marketplace (expo hall).

## Questions you might want to ask your friendly ['Cloud App Lab Pro'](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RBtAOjxmUh97fXrJlowvqVNmq2-8FxvBIHx2Dts1Jh8/pub?start=true&loop=true&delayms=1000) via twitter/irc:
 - Why does OpenStack require all its code to be reviewed +1'd by a member of the OpenStack community and validated +2'd by a core contributor?
 - How do I know projects are robust and ready to be used in production?  Hint: adoption, maturity, age.
 - Where can I get further information on 'big tent' OpenStack projects? See: https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator
