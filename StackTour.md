# StackTour Application Laboratory

Welcome to the OpenStack Cloud App Lounge!  Below you will find the first app lab challenges.  Each lab is a playful way to see if you have what it takes to be a ['Cloud Application Engineer'](/cloud-application-engineer.md). 

![Each OpenStack Project is a robot army witing for your push-button commands](http://image.slidesharecdn.com/openstack4thbirthdaydeck-140718151122-phpapp02/95/openstack-4th-birthday-1-638.jpg?cb=1405696337)

Don't forget to [setup your laptop with the OpenStack powered cloud of your choice](/prereq) 

# Lab learning objectives (by completing this lab you will know how to...)
 - ...identify the core project APIs which make up all OpenStack powered clouds.
 - ...meet key community members who can help you navigate the world of OpenStack.
 - ...understand the diligence of community based code review (as per the OpenStack-way of +1/+2 code review).

## Lab challenge context:
  - Imagine the CTO of your company has just asked you to give the 'board of directors' an overview of which OpenStack projects the company should know about so they can make a decision on where to have their engineers participate.
  - As fast as you can (your meeting is in fifteen minutes!), you need to learn what each of the major OpenStack projects do and how they relate to the main OpenStack dashboard.  
  - To best explain OpenStack to the bosses, magine that each project is an robot and that project-robot goes off and does something for the user.  You need to explain what each robot does!
  - If Google isn't fast enough get one of the Cloud App Pros to help, ask questions!  Go, go, go!
  - Remember your boses won't understand all the functions of robots which work for each project, so you need to have simple (tweetable) explanations.
  - Most importantly don't forget that your boss will ask you for contacts in the OpenStack community so you can start asking questions on how to get involved.  Start building that rolodex of community contacts!

 ## How to complete this lab (to win your StackSwag points):
  - Tweet a picture of a button on the OpenStack button and explain what kind of robot it is!
  - You'll get Stacker swag point(s) for every picture you tweet showing a button which represents one of the different Core OpenStack projects (see below).
  - Send pictures for the following OpenStack project-robots along with what this army of project robots can do!
   - [ ] Nova = +1 StackerSwag points
   - [ ] Neutron = +1 StackerSwag points
   - [ ] Swift = +1 StackerSwag points
   - [ ] Cinder = +1 StackerSwag points
   - [ ] Glance = +1 StackerSwag points

Once you've collected points for each of the core projects above, you can gain additional bonus points by tweeting an image of a button which makes calls to the following other 'big tent' projects (you can only collect point below after you've collected points from the above):

 - [ ] Magnum = +2 StackerSwag points
 - [ ] Murano = +2 StackerSwag points
 - [ ] Zun = = +2 StackerSwag points
 
## To redeem your points: 
Go to the 'Cloud App Lounge' helpdesk in the Marketplace (expo hall) and show your tweets+picture after they have been "‚ù§'d" by one of our ['cloud app lab pros' via their twitter+irc handles](/cloud-app-lab-pros) <-- don't forget to get your tweets +1'd with a heart.

## Questions you might want to ask your friendly ['Cloud App Lab Pro'](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RBtAOjxmUh97fXrJlowvqVNmq2-8FxvBIHx2Dts1Jh8/pub?start=true&loop=true&delayms=1000) via twitter/irc:
 - Why does OpenStack require all its code to be reviewed +1'd by a member of the OpenStack community and validated +2'd by a core contributor?
 - How do I know projects are robust and ready to be used in production?  Hint: adoption, maturity, age.
 - Where can I get further information on 'big tent' OpenStack projects? See: https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator
