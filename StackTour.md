.#!= don't forget to [setup your laptop with the OpenStack powered cloud of your choice](/prereq)

Welcome to the OpenStack Cloud App Lounge!  Below you will find the first (1of6) app lab challenges.  Each lab is a playful way to see if you have what it takes to be a ['Cloud Application Engineer'](/cloud-application-engineer.md).  

# Lab learning objectives (by completing this lab you will know how to...)
 - ...identify the core project APIs which make up all OpenStack powered clouds.
 - ...meet key community members who can help you navigate the world of OpenStack.
 - ...understand the diligence of community based code review (as per the OpenStack-way of +1/+2 code review).

## Lab challenge context:
Imagine your boss has just asked you to give them an overview of which OpenStack projects the company should get involved with given your companies users needs to use OpenStack.  As fast as you can (your meeting is in fifteen minutes!), you need to provide pictures of which buttons in the OpenStack dashboard apply to which projects (your bosses don't understand code, they have just since the Horizon dashboard).  Most importantly don't forget that your boss will ask you for contacts in the OpenStack community so you can start asking questions on how to get involved.  Start building that rolodex of community contacts!

## How to complete this lab (to win your StackSwag points):
--> You'll get Stacker swag point(s) for every picture you tweet showing a button on an OpenStack cloud which represents the following [core OpenStack projects](https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator/).  For example, here is a picture of a button which works with the Keystone project API:

![Image of OpenStack login screen via default horizon dashboard, which makes calls to the keystone API for authentication of users](/Selection_063.png "Default login screen which makes 'calls to the keystone project API to login users")

You can collect points by sending a tweet (like the above ^^) with a picture showing buttons which make API calls to:
  - [ ] Nova = +1 StackerSwag points
  - [ ] Neutron = +1 StackerSwag points
  - [ ] Swift = +1 StackerSwag points
  - [ ] Cinder = +1 StackerSwag points
  - [ ] Glance = +1 StackerSwag points
  
Once you've collected points for each of the core projects above, you can gain additional bonus points by tweeting an image of a button which makes calls to the following other 'big tent' projects (you can only collect point below after you've collected points from the above):

 - [ ] Magnum = +2 StackerSwag points
 - [ ] Murano = +2 StackerSwag points
 - [ ] Zun = = +2 StackerSwag points
 
## To redeem your points: 
Go to the 'Cloud App Lounge' helpdesk in the Marketplace (expo hall) and show your tweets+picture after they have been "‚ù§'d" by one of our ['cloud app lab pros' via their twitter+irc handles](/cloud-app-lab-pros) <-- don't forget to get your tweets +1'd with a heart.

## Questions you might want to ask your friendly ['Cloud App Lab Pro'](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RBtAOjxmUh97fXrJlowvqVNmq2-8FxvBIHx2Dts1Jh8/pub?start=true&loop=true&delayms=1000) via twitter/irc:
 - Why does OpenStack require all its code to be reviewed +1'd by a member of the OpenStack community and validated +2'd by a core contributor?
 - How do I know projects are robust and ready to be used in production?  Hint: adoption, maturity, age.
 - Where can I get further information on 'big tent' OpenStack projects? See: https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator
