Other than a laptop, you'll need a cloud (aka datacentre) to finish each lab.

The following clouds are available for use (and have ben tested by the [OpenStack Marketplace](https://www.openstack.org/marketplace/public-clouds/)) to work with the various lab challenges:

 - [x] [OVH](/ovh) (official cloud sponsor of the OpenStack Academy at the Barcelona Summit)
 - [x] [Internap](/internap.md)
 - [x] [DataCentred](/datacentred.md)
 - [x] [CityCloud](/citycloud.md)
 - [x] [Mirantis](/mirantis.md)
 
 If you have trouble getting onto any of these, please don't hesitate to send a question via tweet using the [#CloudApp](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CloudApp) hashtag, community cloud app guru will be monitorring this channel throughout to come and provide you face-to-face help.
