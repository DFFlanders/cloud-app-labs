# StackScale Application Laboratory

Welcome to the OpenStack Cloud App Lounge!  Below you will find the fourth 'cloud app lab' challenge.  Each lab is a playful way to see if you have what it takes to be a ['Cloud Application Engineer'](/cloud-application-engineer.md) - the future of apps.

Don't forget to [setup your laptop with the OpenStack powered cloud of your choice](/prereq).
