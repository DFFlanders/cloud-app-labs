Welcome to the OpenStack Cloud App Lounge!  Below you will find the second (2of6) app lab challenges.  Each lab is a playful way to see if you have what it takes to be a ['Cloud Application Engineer'](/cloud-application-engineer.md). 

Disclaimer:  Labs provide you with three clues: a.) context for what you need to do to complete the challenge, b.) ingredients for what resources you'll need to complete the lab; and most importantly c.) people whom you should contact to get help when you get stuck trying to solve the lab.  The way to win is *who* not *what* #WeAreOpenStack
