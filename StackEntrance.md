# StackEntrance Lab
.#!= don't forget to [setup your laptop with the OpenStack powered cloud of your choice](/prereq)

Welcome to the OpenStack Cloud App Lounge!  Below you will find the second (2of6) app lab challenges.  Each lab is a playful way to see if you have what it takes to be a ['Cloud Application Engineer'](/cloud-application-engineer.md).

# Lab learning objectives _(by completing this lab you will know how to...)_
 - [x] ...find the API endpoints for each OpenStack cloud so you can control the datacentre via command line (instead of clicking buttons on a dashboard).
 - [x] ...maintain login credentials for multiple clouds worldwide via a single secure file (clouds.yaml)
 - [x] ...connect to 2+ or more OpenStack powered clouds so you can build applications at the datacentre of your choosing.
 
 ## Context for completing the lab:
 - Because of EU Safe Harbour laws the cloud application you have just built requires that it be run from two different European countries.  Fortunatley, OpenStack has numerous OpenStack powered clouds which you can choose from to run your cloud app.  
 - By building your cloud app on multiple clouds you are helping assure your app is not locked to a single cloud operating (infrastructure) system.  
 
 ## Win StackerPoints for completing this lab:
  - Show that you have connected to two different datacenters by tweeting two public URLs which can be pinged by one of our [Cloud App Lab Pros](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RBtAOjxmUh97fXrJlowvqVNmq2-8FxvBIHx2Dts1Jh8/pub?start=true&loop=false&delayms=2000).  Use the hashtag [#CloudApp](https://twitter.com/hashtag/cloudapp) to get the attention of a pro.
  - Ask for one of the Cloud App Lab Pros to verify that these two URLs are pingable by giving your tweet a "❤".
  - Once you have solved your lab and had it +1'd then head to the _cloud app lab_ lounge to show your evidence to recieve your Stacker points.
  - Once you have collected enough lab points, you can [turn them into Stacker swag!](/StackerPoints)

 ## Ingredients you'll need to complete the lab:
  - You'll need [accounts on each cloud you are going to use](/prereq.md).  Hint: if the cloud you are using is a native OpenStack cloud then you should be able to find the endpoints via the dashboard: Compute > Access & Security > API Access.
  - Find the API endpoints for the clouds you want to work with via (http://docs.openstack.org/developer/os-client-config/vendor-support.html)
  - [Install the os-cloud-config library so your laptop can talk to any OpenStack cloud in the world](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/os-cloud-config/installation.html).  Hint: save your cloud credentials in a clouds.yaml file for ease of use.
  
 ## Lab pros who can help you complete the lab 
 Open Source is about knowing *who* as much as it is about knowing *what*.
