.#!= don't forget to [setup your laptop with the OpenStack powered cloud of your choice](/prereq)

Welcome to the OpenStack Cloud App Lounge!  Below you will find the second (2of6) app lab challenges.  Each lab is a playful way to see if you have what it takes to be a ['Cloud Application Engineer'](/cloud-application-engineer.md). 

# Lab learning objectives (by completing this lab you will know how to...)
 - [x] ...find the API endpoints for each OpenStack cloud so you can control the datacentre via command line (instead of clicking buttons on a dashboard).
 - [x] ...connect to 2+ more OpenStack powered clouds so you can build applications at the datacentre of your choosing.
 
 ## Lab challenge context:
 Because of EU Safe Harbour laws the cloud application you have just built requires that it be run from two different European countries.  Fortunatley, OpenStack has numerous OpenStack powered clouds which you can choose from to run your cloud app.  
 
 ## To win the StackerPoints for this challenge:
  - Show that you have connected to two different datacenters by posting two public URLs which can be pinged 
  - ask for one of the Cloud App Lab Pros to verify that these two URLs are pingable by giving your tweet a "❤". 

 ## Ingredients you will need to complete this lab:
  
  - You'll need [accounts on each cloud you are going to use](/prereq.md).  Hint: if the cloud you are using is a native OpenStack cloud then you should be able to find the endpoints via the dashboard: Compute > Access & Security > API Access.
  - Find the API endpoints for the clouds you want to work with via (http://docs.openstack.org/developer/os-client-config/vendor-support.html)
  - [Install the os-cloud-config library so your laptop can talk to any OpenStack cloud in the world](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/os-cloud-config/installation.html).  Hint: save your cloud credentials in a clouds.yaml file for ease of use.
  
  ## Lab pros who can help (open source is about knowing *who* as much as it is about knowing *what*)
